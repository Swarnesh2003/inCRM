# inCRM
This is a simple customer management website built using django as a middleware and react as the front-end. 
This performs basic CRUD operations for adding, deleting and editing the customer data.


I have planned to implement further functionalities to the website so that it will become a complete customer relationship management software.
I have planning to add campaign options to send automated email to the customer in order to improve the business.
A survey will also be sent to the customer to obtain the customer experience via email and the business unit can view it in the website so that they can make business conclusions from that.
The idea for this project has been inspired from the SAP CRM software that I used during my internship at FORD Motors Pvt Ltd.
